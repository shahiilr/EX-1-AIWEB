title: Online Event Registration & Promotional Portal Using HTML5 (Form + Media Elements)
the description of the project.
The portal allows users to view details of an upcoming event through HTML5 media elements (image banner, promotional video, background audio).
 Users can then register for the event using an HTML5 form with various input types (text, email, date, radio buttons, select menus, textarea, file upload).
This experiment demonstrates the integration of multimedia content and interactive form elements in a modern HTML5 webpage.
##producer :
Create a new HTML5 file (e.g., event.html).
Add the basic structure using <!DOCTYPE html> and <html>, <head>, <body> tags.
Insert an event banner image using the <img> tag.
Add a promotional video using the <video> tag with controls.
Insert background/intro audio using the <audio> tag.
Create an event registration form using:
<input type="text">, <input type="email">, <input type="date">
<input type="radio">, <select>, <textarea>
<input type="file">, <input type="submit">
Test the webpage in a browser.
Validate the form and check media playback.
